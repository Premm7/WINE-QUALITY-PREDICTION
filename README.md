This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using machine learning techniques based on various physicochemical features such as acidity, pH level, alcohol percentage, and sulphates. The goal is to build a reliable model that helps classify wine quality using numerical input data. The popular Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used as the foundation for model training and evaluation. Through preprocessing, normalization, and feature analysis, the model identifies patterns that correlate with wine rating scores.
Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting can be applied and compared to identify the best-performing model. The project includes evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess performance. Once the best model is selected, it is saved using Pickle or Joblib for reuse without retraining.
This project also supports deployment using a simple Flask web interface where users can input wine properties and get a quality prediction instantly. It can be extended further by improving preprocessing, tuning hyperparameters, or deploying using cloud services. Overall, it demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow — from data loading and training to evaluation and real-time prediction.
